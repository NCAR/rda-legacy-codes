This directory contains routines which may be useful for reading
data from external devices such as Exabyte or 1/2" tapes on to UNIX
disk files.  The form of the resultant disk file can range from
an exact copy of the string of bytes on the tape to Cray COSblocked
files where each block on the media becomes one COSblocked record.


tape2diskbin.c  c code to read a binary, possibly multifile, tape
		media and create disk file(s) with an exact copy
		of bytes on the media.

tape2disk.c     c code to copy data from tape to a disk file with
		options for linefeed insertion (ASCII input) or
		exact copy (binary input).

tape2disk.f     fortran code to copy data from tape to a disk file
		with options for linefeed insertion (ASCII input) or
		exact copy (binary input).  Uses fortran extensions
		which may not be available on all compilers, BUT write
		statments could be replaced with locally available
		options.

tape2cosb.f     Fortran code to read tape media and create a
		Cray COSblocked file.

tape2tape.f     Fortran code to make an exact tape copy.

tapescan.f      Fortran code to summarize contents of a tape.

tapediag.c      c program to diagnose tapes where content is
		unknown
