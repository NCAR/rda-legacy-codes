C     CALL T_LOGICAL(DEVICENAME,LDRV) to associate a
C     particular DEVICENAME with a given logical drive number, LDRV.
C     Normally default associations will be set up for you
C     on a system-wide basis.

C     CALL WITH:
C        CALL T_READ(LDRV,BUFFER,LENGTH)
C        where
C           LDRV is a logical magtape drive number. ie LOGICAL_MAGTAPE_nn
C           where LOGICAL_MAGTAPE_00 is often MTA0:
C           BUFFER is buffer address,
C           LENGTH is number of bytes
C
C           Also, execution is asynchronous.

C     CALL WITH:
C        CALL T_WRIT(LDRV,BUFFER,LENGTH)
C        where
C           LDRV is a logical magtape drive number.
C           Generally LOGICAL_MAGTAPE_00 points to MTA0:
C           BUFFER is buffer address,
C           LENGTH is number of bytes
C
C           Also, execution is asynchronous.

C     CALL T_WAIT(LDRV,NSTATE,NBYTES) forces
C     completion of IO on the unit.
C
C           LDRV is logical magtape drive number.

C                      3      => EOT
C             NBYTES = NUMBER OF BYTES IN LAST TRANSFER

C        CALL T_WEOF(LDRV) writes an EOF
C        where
C           LDRV is a logical magtape drive number.
C
C           Also, execution is asynchronous.

C        CALL T_SKPF(LDRV,NUMBER)  skips NUMBER files
C        where
C           LDRV is a logical magtape drive number.
C           NUMBER is the number of files to skip
C
C           Also, execution is asynchronous.
