<p>COS-blocking refers to the control words placed around each record by the Cray Operating System.  Although we no longer use Cray computers at NCAR, many of our older datasets contain COS-blocked data files.  This blocking is especially useful in the case of variable-length records.  We have several utilities and libraries for dealing with COS-blocking.</p>
