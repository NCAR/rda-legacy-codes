	 In formatted IO, UNICOS 7 has limits 267 chars input and 133 output
	 which may be overridden with segloader directives.  Version 8 will
	 recognize OPEN (...,recl=___,...).  In the mean time, add segloader
	 directives; e.g.,

	 '-D SET=$RBUFLN:522;COMMONS=$RFDCOM:531;SET=$WBUFLN:166;COMMONS=$WFDCOM:175'
	 specifies a read max lrecl = 522 bytes and a write max of 166 bytes.

	ftp to the DEC system creates 512 byte records.
	Code is available to make a plain binary file
	from the file created by ftp.

	If a user is on a DEC VMS system using ftp, it is
	difficult to mix the case of entries.  Enclosing the
	objects of commands in double quotes will usually
	fix this problem (ie cd "COADS").

	 Fortran character string default size limit is 500 bytes.  The compiler
	 option "-q charlen=nnnn"  will define a larger default.  The actual
	 compiler is xlf and f77 simply invokes xlf.

	 The driver for Exabytes (and probably other tapes) has a blocksize
	 definition which must be set to "0" for our device read codes to
	 work.  It is often set to some specific block length by default.

		   properly if specific codes are expected from IOSTAT.

	 SWAP4 using LOGICAL*1 does not seem to work.  CHARACTER*1 replacing
	 LOGICAL*1 seems to work, but the best choice for byte swapping is
	 the convert='big_endian' option in the OPEN statement.
	 
	 If input is a character variable holding binary data the convert =
	 'big_endian' will not work.  The swap4 approach is necessary.
