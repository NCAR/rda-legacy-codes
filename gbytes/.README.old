GBYTES code is used by many DSS programs to handle binary packing.
There are versions available for most popular computer systems as well
as FORTRAN and C versions which have application on many computer systems.
Most users should be able to simply select the version for their system
and assemble (compile) this version and link it to their main program.

The file "gbytes.doc" contains more detailed information on
the various versions of GBYTES in this directory.  Some files were added
later and are not discussed in this document.

The "msgbytei.for" and "msgbytes.c" files are PC versions of GBYTES for
Microsoft fortran and C users.  The C file is a minor variation of the
C.C file and the fortran file is an interface routine which allows
fortran programs to call C subroutines.  The fortran package also
contains the SWAP4 routine which can be used the handle the byte
swapping problem on PCs.  The "swap.for" program contains byte swapping
subroutines for 4 and 2 byte swapping.  These are primarily useful
on DEC machines for handling the byte swapping problem.

The file "msgbytes.for" is a stand alone FORTRAN version of GBYTES
and SBYTES for use with Microsoft FORTRAN.  It could probably be
adapted for other PC compilers.  "unix.f" is a FORTRAN version for
Sun Unix.  Note that "unix.f and the generic FORTRAN version
require a call to INITAL to initialize the routines.  Other versions
are set up for the specific systems and do not have the INITAL
entry point. rs6000.f is a slightly modified version of unix.f which
should work on IBM RS6000 stations.

Following is a list of the files.  See "gbytes.doc" for more information.
Where more than one version appears for a particular computer, version 1 (V1)
is the recommended version.
