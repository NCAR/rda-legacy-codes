<p>GBYTES and SBYTES are packages used by many of our programs to handle binary unpacking and packing.  We have generic Fortran, Fortran-callable, C, and C++ versions of the packages, as well as system-specific code for many types of systems.  If you are having trouble deciding which version you need, we have compiled a <a href="http://dss.ucar.edu/docs/usage_hints/systems_info">list of information about various systems</a>, which includes the versions of choice for each system.</p>
